# Brain-Tumor-Classification
This is my thesis during my Bachelors Degree where I have improved an existing brain MRI dataset through manual augmentations, which resulted in more accurate detection and classification of brain tumors utilizing deep neural networks.

### The manual augmentation techniques that were applied are:
#### Salt and Pepper Noise
#### Histogram Equalization
#### Clockwise and Anti-clockwise Rotations
#### Horizontal and Vertical Flipping
#### Brightening and Darkening

### Dataset
The initial MRI dataset that was used and improved in this work can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri).
